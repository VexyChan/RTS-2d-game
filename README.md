<h1>Missing for graphing:</h1>
<p>Nodes arent link and cords arent set besides for the first one</P>
<p>logic isnt setup for idle state vs move state</P>
<p>Logic explination the logic would be an if statment to set the enemy state to attack if within rannge it would just stop moving</p>
<P>the enemy once killing the ally unit would go to move state</p>
<P>for addtioional spawning once a tic timmer incrssed to 200 a new enemy would spawn on each diffrent spawn node</p>
<h1>Controls:</h1>
<p>The Controls are now click and drag to where you want the unit</p>
<p>To build a building you click on the building on the menu then click where you wish to place it<p>
<p>to build units you must have a barracks and click on it</p>
<p>To return to the building menu when you are on the unit menu you click the hq</p>
<h1>All games must feature:</h1>

<p>Mouse input mostly working units will patrol along a vector click within 2-3 boxes then click the direction you wand the unit to go</p>
<p>at least 8 unique sounds associated with game event [6 of 8]</p>
<p>keep the game entities on the map in reasonable ways done for buildings</p>
<p>have three resources that can be collected on the map [0 of 3]</p>
<p>give the player a small number of starting units  [1 unit given]</p>
<p>allow the user to create buildings on the map which allow the player to build additional unit types done</p>
<p>have at least four types of units in total [4 /4]</p>
<p>have at least four types of buildings [Done]</p>
<p>some buildings need to be built before others [done] must build metal mine to build more advanced units</p>
<p>have a way of telling your resources harvesting units to harvest resources | Not done Game uses buildings to harvest resources not troops</p>
<p>have a way for units to attack other units [Done]</p>
<p>have a way for units to attack and either destroy units have hp associated with them that will be taken down via aoe check of if unit a is inside of unit b's attack or if a structure is it takes damage untill it has 0 hp then is destroyed | [done]</p>
<p>For your three maps, offer the player their choice of three maps to play on Done via the main menu // issue until game is compleat only one map playable each map will be done in its own view to allow diffrent spawn for starting buildings and starting units for both sides</p>
<p>for this initial game, have an enemy base on the opposite side of the map from the player with several starting units (more than the player gets) and a couple of buildings already built enemies get 4 units</p>

<li>Game will let you place on building walls/ bridge</li>\
<li>fix missing layers on tile map layer 3 and 4 are not found??</li>
